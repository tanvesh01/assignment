Project is built on Next.js and deployed on Vercel

## How styling in this project works

1. For Styling I am using stitches, which has a fully typed API for implementing css-in-js.
2. Have Built a small design system inside `styles/stitches.ts` and Some components that are used throughout the page inside `src/GlobalComponents`

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
